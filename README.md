## Features
Launchpad Interface: The application emulates the interface of a Launchpad MIDI controller, providing a grid of buttons that can be assigned to different functions in Ableton Live.
Button Mapping: Users can easily map the launchpad buttons to specific actions within Ableton Live, such as launching clips, controlling mixer parameters, or activating effects.
Scene Control: The launchpad grid is organized into scenes, allowing users to switch between different sets of buttons for controlling different aspects of their live performance or studio workflow.
Visual Feedback: The application provides visual feedback to indicate the status of buttons, such as highlighting active clips or indicating the current state of a parameter.
Customization: Users have the flexibility to customize the appearance and behavior of the launchpad application to suit their preferences and workflow.
MIDI Integration: The application communicates with Ableton Live via MIDI, ensuring reliable and low-latency control over the software.
